pynput.keyboard --> Listener, Key (For special keys)
pynput.mouse --> Listener, Controller (for position)

mouse listener passes three arguments 
--> x, y, button, pressed
--> button is enum, use .name

pyautogui --> moveTo(x, y, duration), click(x, y, duration=..., button=...)

Circular imports --> when two or more modules depend on each other

threading --> Thread(target=function_name), no brackets for function name
--> .start(), .stop() (this only applies for Listener, from pynput), .join()
--> start() creates the thread and allows other executes in the main thread to execute
--> .join() creates the thread and it has to finish execution for the other statements in the main thread to execute
--> .is_alive() to check if a thread is active or not
--> for normal threads, you need a flag to allow the program to know when to start and stop the thread, use return False to stop the thread
